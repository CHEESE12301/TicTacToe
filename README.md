This project is a game of tic tac toe with a 1 player mode which is where the player is versing a computer as well as a 2 player mode where the player is versing another player.
Players can store their information inside a database by logging in where the name is saved.

This project is installed by downloading the zip file and opening it on vs code or other applications where it is able to be run.

Alternatively, all files can be installed seperately and put into a file along with installing pygame using this link:
https://www.pygame.org/download.shtml

In this application to log in, you put in the name you would want to use and then it will take you to the game screen where you will verse a computer if the second player name is left as blank. 
If the second player is filled out, Then it will save scores for both players. The application also has a leaderboard where all stats are saved such as the amount of wins, losses, plays and the
winrate.

In the game screen, Player 1 will start first upon logging in. If a player loses, then the opposing player will start first. If the game results in a draw, a random player will start first. To play
the game, Player 1 will place an X into the grid and players take turns putting their marks into the empty squares. The first player to get 3 in a row (horizontally, vertically or diagonally) will be
the winner.

Players can also switch between 1 player and 2 player. To do this, press 1 on the keyboard to go into 1 player mode and verse the computer or press 2 on the keyboard and verse a player. If the player does
not have an account, it will create a new guest account.
